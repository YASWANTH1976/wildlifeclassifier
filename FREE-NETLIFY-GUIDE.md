# Completely FREE Netlify Deployment Guide

Your wildlife recognition app now works **100% free** on Netlify! No paid environment variables needed.

## How It Works (FREE Solution)

✅ **No Environment Variables Required** - Users enter their own API keys
✅ **localStorage Storage** - API keys saved in user's browser only  
✅ **Direct Google Vision API** - Calls go straight from browser to Google
✅ **No Server Costs** - Static files only, no backend needed
✅ **Private & Secure** - API keys never touch your servers

## Step 1: Deploy to Netlify (2 minutes)

1. **Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)** and sign up (free)

2. **Drag & Drop Deployment**
   - Drag the entire `dist/public/` folder onto Netlify
   - Your app will be live instantly at `random-name-123.netlify.app`

3. **That's it!** No environment variables needed.

## Step 2: How Users Use Your App

When someone visits your deployed app:

1. **They see your wildlife recognition interface**
2. **Click "API Setup" tab** to enter their Google Vision API key
3. **Key saves in their browser** (localStorage)
4. **Upload images and get wildlife identification!**

## Getting Free Google Vision API Key

Your users need to:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create free project (Google gives $300 free credit)

## Alternative: Git Integration (Optional)

For automatic deployments when you update code:

1. **Push code to GitHub** (free)
2. **Connect GitHub to Netlify** (free)
3. **Auto-deploy on code changes** (free)

Build settings in `netlify.toml`:
- Build command: `cd client && npm ci && npm run build`

## Testing Locally

To test the localStorage API key functionality:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to "API Setup" tab
3. Enter a test Google Vision API key
4. Upload an image and verify it works
5. Refresh the page - API key should still be remembered

Your app will work exactly the same when deployed to Netlify!
